## Definition

The Bus Factor, also known as the Contributor Absence Factor, is an indicator defined by the [CHAOSS community](https://chaoss.community). For a detailed definition of this indicator, please refer to [CHAOSS Metrics - Bus Factor](https://chaoss.community/metric-bus-factor/).

The Bus Factor is a compelling metric because it visualizes the question "How many contributors can we lose before a project stalls?". It is the smallest number of people that make 50% of contributions to the project & indicates a measure of the project's resilience to losing key contributors (including maintainers).

> It helps identify how widely the work in a project is distributed across contributors as well as the key people in a project that are doing the majority of the work.
