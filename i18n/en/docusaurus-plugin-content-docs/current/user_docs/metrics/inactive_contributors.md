## Definition

Inactive Contributors is a metric defined by [CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community), see [CHAOSS Metrics - Inactive Contributors](https://chaoss.community/kb/metric-inactive-contributors/) for the detailed definition of this metric.

Inactive Contributors is a metric that shows how many contributors have stopped contributing over a specific period of time. The period of time required for a contributor to be counted as inactive can be decided by a variable (default as 6 months) and this metric will display the number of contributors that have been labeled as inactive over a given time frame.

> Inactive Contributors helps determine how many people have stopped contributing actively. This could be useful for community managers to determine if key members are losing interest, or are taking a break.
